The winning player collects from each other player the value of the cards remaining in that player’s hand as follows:
Each eight = 50 points
Each K, Q, J or 10 = 10 points
Each ace = 1 point
Each other card is the pip value
////


The Deal:

Deal 5 cards to every player. The balance of the pack is placed face down in the center of the table and forms the stock. The dealer turns up the top card and places it in a separate pile; this card is the “starter.”.



The Play:

Starting to a random player, each player must place one card face up on the starter pile. Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination.

Example: If the Q of Clubs is the starter, any club may be played on it or any Queen.

If unable to play, cards are drawn from the top of the stock until a play is possible, or until the stock is exhausted.
